# A Puzzle Game By Mark Ross
Inspired by Taiji and the Witness, this game will present the player with grid-based rotation puzzles without explicit instructions. The player will have to figure out the rules from the puzzles they have already solved. It might become my A-level computer science project, or could stay a side project.
